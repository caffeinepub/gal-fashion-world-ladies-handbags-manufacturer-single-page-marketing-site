# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the currently deployed Gal Fashion World single-page site fully public/live using the production domain slug `galfashionworld-2014`.

**Planned changes:**
- Run/complete the production/public publish workflow so the deployment becomes publicly accessible (not draft/review-only).
- Ensure the publish workflow uses the production slug `galfashionworld-2014` exactly as defined in `frontend/domain-slug.json` (and aligned with `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md`), avoiding slug validation errors.

**User-visible outcome:** The Gal Fashion World site is accessible as the live/production public deployment under the production slug `galfashionworld-2014`.
