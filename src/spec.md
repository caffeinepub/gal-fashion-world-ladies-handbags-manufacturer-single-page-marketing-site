# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the current site online (production/public).

**Planned changes:**
- Configure and run the production/public publish workflow using the canonical production slug `galfashionworld-2014` so slug validation passes.
- Keep the existing UI/UX, copy, backend features, and data persistence unchanged during publishing.

**User-visible outcome:** The current site is accessible online as a production/public deployment.
