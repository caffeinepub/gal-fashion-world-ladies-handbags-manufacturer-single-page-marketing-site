# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a front-page showcase that highlights Gal Fashion World bags by material/craftsmanship, covering six specific materials.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new front-page section (or extend the existing BagGallery) to showcase bag materials/craftsmanship within the existing single-page scroll flow.
- Display 6 responsive material tiles/cards, each with a representative image from `/assets/generated/...` and an English caption: "Cotton Canvas", "Cotton Towel", "Jacquard", "Paper Raffia", "Jute", and "Beads / Embroidery".
- Add appropriate English alt text for each material image (material + bag type) and ensure visuals match the existing site theme.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll the homepage and see a dedicated materials showcase with six clearly labeled material categories, each illustrated with an image.
