BagGallery was updated to include the new Jute and Black & White Canvas cards with the requested asset URLs, but the old towel-based card appears to remain (renamed to \"Cotton Towel\"), and the new static asset files themselves were not added per the diff summary. There is also an unrelated Hero typography change (inline fontSize) not requested.",
