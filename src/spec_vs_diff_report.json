  "summary": "The diff adds documentation and automated slug-validation checks (a Node validation script and a GitHub Actions workflow) to ensure the production slug equals \"galfashionworld-2014\". However, it does not provide evidence of an actual production/public publish workflow being executed or configured to make the deployment publicly accessible/live.",

      "requirement": "Proceed with the production/public publish workflow to make the currently deployed Gal Fashion World single-page website fully public/live using production slug \"galfashionworld-2014\".",
      "reason": "The changes add validation/guardrails and a deployment guide, but the diff summary does not show any implementation or configuration of a production/public publish workflow (e.g., deployment pipeline/job, publish command integration, or hosting platform configuration) that would actually perform the public/live publish and ensure the resulting deployment is publicly accessible.",
