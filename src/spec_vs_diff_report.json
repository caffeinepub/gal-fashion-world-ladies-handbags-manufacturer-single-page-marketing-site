  "summary": "BagGallery.tsx was extended with a new “Materials & Craftsmanship” section and a `materials` array that includes all six required material names and references six images under `/assets/generated/...` with per-image alt text. However, the diff does not show the addition of the required image files under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and the truncated snippet does not conclusively show that each material card renders the required visible name caption.",

      "requirement": "Add and display one representative image per requested material in the new/updated front-page materials showcase, using static assets stored under frontend/public/assets/generated and referenced directly from the frontend.",
      "reason": "The code references six `/assets/generated/...` images, but the diff shows no new files added under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, so it’s not evidenced that the required images were actually added to the repo and will load successfully.",
      "evidence": [

      "requirement": "There are 6 material cards/tiles, each showing an image plus the material name caption.",
