  "summary": "REQ-27 and REQ-28 appear implemented via global CSS/Tailwind typography changes and a fixed 20px Hero heading size. BagGallery materials list now includes the two requested user-image assets with the exact labels and appropriate English alt text, and no longer shows the prior Jacquard / Beads-Embroidery entries (based on the visible list). However, the diff does not show the required static image files being added under frontend/public, and it’s not fully verifiable from the provided diff that *all* <video> elements across the entire UI are removed (only Hero is shown). There are also unrelated documentation/state summary edits not requested.",
